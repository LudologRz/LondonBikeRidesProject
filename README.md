# London Bike Rides Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike ride patterns in London, exploring how **weather conditions** and **time** influence ride frequency. Interactive visualizations were created in **Tableau** to uncover trends and insights from ride data collected between **[start date]** and **[end date]**.

## Goals
- Understand how **temperature** and **wind speed** affect ride frequency.  
- Identify **temporal patterns** in ride activity throughout the day and over time.  
- Provide an **interactive dashboard** for exploring ride data in detail.

## Key Features
### Heat Map: Temperature vs Wind Speed
- Visualizes ride frequency as a heat map.  
- Interactive tooltips display:
  - Temperature (°C)  
  - Wind speed (km/h)  
  - Hour of the day (0–23)  
  - Weather type  
  - Number of rides  
- Adjust the **moving average period** to smooth trends and update both the heat map and line chart.

### Line Chart: Rides Over Time
- Shows total rides relative to time.  
- Interactive tooltips provide:
  - Date  
  - Number of rides  
  - Weather type  
  - Hour of the day  
- Updates dynamically based on the moving average period.

### Interactive Tooltips
- Hover over heat map cells or line chart points for detailed insights.  
- Enables in-depth exploration without cluttering the visuals.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** - Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation, built-in aggregations used

## How to Use
1. Open the Tableau dashboard (`London_Bike_Rides.twbx`).  
2. Adjust the **moving average period** to smooth trends.  
3. Hover over heat map cells or line chart points for detailed ride data.
